# Spotify History Parser
Want to see your Spotify stats like listening time, most played songs (and how many times you've played each one), what your most frequent listening hours are, and more? I did, which is why I'm making this little tool which will display your Spotify history in a more friendly format than the raw JSON download!

##Web version now available!
Link to the website [here](https://github.com/Hubbit200/spotify-history-parser-web)

## Instructions:
1. Log in to Spotify in a web browser (the app does't have what you need)
2. Go to the privacy settings in your account area (top right of the Spotify home website once you've logged in, then around half way down the categories on the left)
3. Scroll down and click to download your data
4. Wait... Spotify seems to take around 3-8 days for it, but says it can take up to 30
5. You'll get an email saying your data is ready - download it!
6. Extract the downloaded folder
7. Download and run this program - latest release in the releases tab on the right of the GitHub page
8. Navigate to the data you downloaded and select the StreamingHistory.json file (it might have a number or two int it as well)
9. Enjoy the data!
