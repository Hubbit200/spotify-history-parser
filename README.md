# spotifyHistoryParser
Want to see your Spotify stats like listening time, most played songs (and how many times you've played each one), what your most frequent listening hours are, and more? I did, which is why I'm making this little tool which will display your Spotify history in a more friendly format than the raw JSON download!

Still needs to be built - currently only runnable by placing the Spotify history data download file into the project's data folder
